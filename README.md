## What is a Keto Diet?
The keto diet is a low-carb, high-fat diet that puts the body into ketosisâ€”a metabolic state where fat becomes the primary fuel source. This process occurs when carbohydrate intake is drastically reduced, and the body starts producing ketones from stored fat.

### Types of Keto Diets
- **Standard Keto Diet (SKD):** High fat (70-75%), moderate protein (20-25%), and low carbohydrates (5-10%).
- **Cyclical Keto Diet (CKD):** Alternating days of high-carb intake (e.g., 5 keto days followed by 2 high-carb days).
- **Targeted Keto Diet (TKD):** Allows carb consumption around workouts.
- **High-Protein Keto Diet (HPKD):** Similar to SKD but with a higher protein intake.
